        <h2>Hello! I'm Rekha</h2>
        <p>
          I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Sri Venkateswara Engineering College. I have hands-on experience with programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, and Iâ€™m proficient in web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Spring Boot.<br><br>
          I have completed two internships: a virtual web development internship with Vaults of Code and an offline full-stack Java internship at Rooman Technologies, where I contributed to both web and mobile application development.<br><br>
          One of my key projects is a Resume Builder application that allows users to input their details and download a professionally formatted resume in PDF format. The project is live on GitHub.<br><br>
          I am enthusiastic about starting my career in the tech industry and am eager to join a team where I can continue learning, take on new challenges, and make meaningful contributions.
